## Problem 1

Recursion can be implemented without resort to mutable environments.  Several
ways are listed below.  Choose one of them and reimplement the
[RCFAE](../../lecturenotes/08-rcfae.scala) language as defined in the lecture
notes.  If you are really enthusiatic and enegetic, try as many of them as
possible.

- The essential idea is to delay the creation of the closure.  There are
  several ways to achieve it, depending on the representation of the
  environment and the evaluation strategy of the meta-language.

    - If the environment is represented as a meta-function.  Then the recursive
      environement is given by a recursive meta-function.

    - If the environment is represented as a stack of bindings in the
      meta-language and the meta-language uses lazy evaluation, then the
      recursive environment is given by a recursive equation.  See [tying the
      knot](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Tying_the_Knot)

    - If the environment is represented as a stack of bindings in the
      meta-language but the meta-language uses eager evaluation, add the
      binding of the lambda-abstraction (instead of a closure) to the name into
      the environment.  Later when the name is looked up, create a closure out
      of the returned lambda-abstraction and the environment from the position
      where the binding is found upwards.  For this to work, the position for
      this binding in the environment must be somehow marked or detected.
      There are two ways to do it:

        - When extending the environment with the binding, use a different tag
          than the tag for normal bindings.  See the paper [Definitional
          Interpreters](http://cs.au.dk/~hosc/local/HOSC-11-4-pp363-397.pdf).

        - Check whether the returned value of a lookup is a lambda-abstraction.

- If the environment is represented as a stack of scopes, each being a
  collection of bindings.  Create a closure at the definition site but save the
  depth of the current environment instead of the environment itself.  Continue
  by adding the binding of the name with this closure to the current
  environment.  Later when the name is looked up, obtain the static environment
  with updated bindings by truncating the current environment by the depth
  saved in the returned closure.

## Problem 2

In [BCFAE](../../lecturenotes/09-bcfae.scala), addresses are first-class values
because `AddressV` is a sub-class of `Value`.  Implement a language where
addresses are not treated as first-class values.  In such a language, the
environment will map all variable names to addresses, where the store maps
addresses to values.
