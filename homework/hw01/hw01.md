# Homework 1

## Problem 1

Extend the implementation for the language AE (as given in the lecture note
[02-ae.scala](../lecturenotes/02-ae.scala)) with a pretty printer.  Give your
definition in functional-style Scala.  Note that your solution should handle
grouping of expressions using parentheses correctly.  That is, put parentheses
around (sub-)expressions only if it is necessary.  Use operator precedences to
achieve that.

## Problem 2

Reimplement the evaluator for the arithmetic-expression language (as given in
the lecture note [02-ae.scala](../lecturenotes/02-ae.scala)) in
object-oriented-style Scala.  Then extend your implementation with a pretty
printer again in object-oriented style.

## Problem 3

Extend your solutions for Problem 1 and Problem 2 to support two more binary
(meaning requiring two operands) arithmetic operators, namely `-` for
subtraction and `/` for division.  Note that you should not edit the source
files containing the solutios for Problem 1 and Problem 2.  Instead, make
copies of them first.  Yes, that is the point. ;)
