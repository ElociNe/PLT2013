# Homework 2

## Problem 1

Implement `map` and `filter` using `fold` over `List[Int]`.  You can find the
definitions of these three higher-order functions in
[ex02.md](../../exercises/ex02.md)

## Problem 2

Extend the evaluator for the language WAE (as given in the lecture note
[03-wae.scala](../../lecturenotes/03-wae.scala)) to support a conditional
construct, known as an `if`-expression.  Note that you need a representation
for booleans.

## Problem 3

Replace the `With` construct in WAE (as given in the lecture note
[03-wae.scala](../../lecturenotes/03-wae.scala)) with `Letp` (_a.k.a._
[`let`](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/let.html?q=parallel%20binding#%28part._.Parallel_.Binding__let%29),
for parallel bindings) and `Lets` (_a.k.a._
[`let*`](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/let.html?q=sequential%20binding&q=parallel%20binding#%28part._.Sequential_.Binding__let_%29),
for sequential bindngs), implement them in the evaluator.  You are free to
choose a substitution-based or an environment-based implementation.  Make
sure your implmentation will handle the two examples we have seen in the
exercise session correctly.  You can find them in
[ex02.md](../../exercises/ex02.md).
