The sample solutions demonstrates my style of implementing a language.  In
particular, I prefer _normalization_ to _evaluation_.  Currently, the source
lacks documentation.  So if you can not understand some part, just send me an
email to ask.  I will be glad to answer and my answer will probably enter into
the source as documentation.  ;)
