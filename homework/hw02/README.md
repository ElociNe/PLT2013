This directory contains sample solutions to [hw02.md](hw02.md).  If you find
problems, you are welcome to send <a
href="mailto:day@informatik.uni-marbug.de">me</a> a bug report by email.

These sample solutions demonstrate my style of implementing a language.  In
particular, I distinguish between _normalization_ and _evaluation_ and are in
favor of the former.  Please think twice before you follow.  ;)

Currently, the code lacks documentation.  So if you can not understand some
part, just send me an email to ask.  I will be glad to answer and my answer may
enter the source as documentation.  ;)
