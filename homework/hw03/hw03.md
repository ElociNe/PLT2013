# Homework 3

## Problem 1

We have seen [FAE](../../lecturenotes/05-fae.scala) has two features:

1. Functions are first-class.

2. It supports anonymous functions.

Anonymous functions are convenient to have but turns out to be _not_ necessary.
A language can support always named first-class functions.  To turn FAE into
such a language, we replace the construct `Fun` with a `With`-like consturct
`WithFun` that first defines a function named `f` with parameter `param` and
function body `fdef`, and then evaluates the expression `body` in which the
function named `f` may be used.  All other things remain unchanged.  Take the
following declarations as a starting point, and implement an environment-based
evaluator for this language.

```scala
abstract class Exp

case class Num(n : Int) extends Exp
case class Id(name : Symbol) extends Exp
case class Add(lhs : Exp, rhs : Exp) extends Exp

case class WithFun(f : Symbol, param : Symbol, fdef : Exp, body : Exp) extends Exp
case class App(funExp : Exp, argExp : Exp) extends Exp

abstract class Value

case class NumV(n : Int) extends Value
case class ClosureV(param : Symbol, body : Exp, env : Env) extends Value

type Env = Map[Symbol, Value]

def eval(exp : Exp, env : Env) : Value = ...
```

Notice that in this language, the `With` construct is missing.  Give a
_definition_ of it (in Scala) in terms of other constructs in the language,
similar to what is done in FAE.  Remember to test your implementation.  In
particular, all examples of FAE should work with minor adaption.

What can you conclude from this exercise?

## Problem 2

Port/translate to Scala the ML implementation of one _normalization_ strategy
(that is, strategy that aims to reduce a lamdba-term to its _normal form_) for
the lambda-calculus presented in the paper [Demonstrating Lambda Calculus
Reduction](http://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/papers/sestoft-lamreduce.pdf).  In the
paper, every strategy given in the first grid of the table in Figure 2 is a
normalization strategy.  Sections 6 (where the term _normal form_ is defined),
7 and 8 of the paper are relevant.

## Problem 3 (Optional)

We have seen [F1WAE](../../lecturenotes/04-f1wae.scala) has two features:

1. Functions are second-class.

2. Function names and variable names live in different namespaces.

When we move from F1WAE on to [FAE](../../lecturenotes/05-fae.scala), we not
only switch to first-class functions, but also unify the two namespaces into
one.  It turns out that the latter change is plausible though not necessary.
We can have a language that supports first-class functions while still keeping
function names and variable names in difference namespaces.  The declarations
given below defines such a language.  We introduce a new construct `Fun` that
wraps a function name into an `Exp`, which evaluates to a closure.  We have two
way to invoke a function.  `Call` can invoke the function bound to the name `f`
directly, whereas `App` has to evaluate `funExp` first.  Similar to the
language in Problem 1, we also introduce a `With`-like construct `WithFun` that
allows the user to define a functioin and use it.  Take these declarations as a
starting point, and implement an environment-based evaluator for this language.

```scala
abstract class Exp

case class Num(n : Int) extends Exp
case class Add(lhs : Exp, rhs : Exp) extends Exp
case class Mul(lhs : Exp, rhs : Exp) extends Exp
case class Id(x : Symbol) extends Exp

case class With(x : Symbol, xdef : Exp, body : Exp) extends Exp

case class Call(f : Symbol, argExp : Exp) extends Exp

case class Fun(f : Symbol) extends Exp
case class App(funExp : Exp, argExp : Exp) extends Exp

case class WithFun(f : Symbol, param : Symbol, fdef : Exp, body : Exp) extends Exp

abstract class Value

case class NumV(n : Int) extends Value
case class ClosureV(param : Symbol, body : Exp, fenv : FEnv, env : Env)

// function environment
type FEnv = Map[Symbol, Closure]

// value environment
type Env = Map[Symbol, Value]
```

Make sure your implementation pass at least the following tests, though you are
encouraged to add more tests.  _Hint:_ Study these tests before starting your
implementation.

```scala
// Variable names refer to their bindings in the value namespace.
val exp1 : Exp =
  WithFun('id, 'x, Id('x),
          With('id, Num(2), Id('id)))

/* Function names refer to their bindings in the function namespace.  A
   function name can be given directly to `Call` to invoke the function bound
   to that name.  Since the function name will be looked up in the function
   namespace rather than the value namespace, it can not be shadowed by the
   same variable name. */
val exp2 : Exp =
  WithFun('id, 'x, Id('x),
          With('id, Num(2), Call('id, Num(1))))

// But a function name can be shadowed by the same function name. */
val exp3 : Exp =
  WithFun('id, 'x, Id('x),
          WithFun('id, 'x, Num(2), Call('id, Num(1))))

/* When a function name is wrapped by `Fun` to an `Exp`, it can no longer
   be invoked by `Call`.  Instead, it must be invoked by `App`. */
val exp4 : Exp =
  WithFun('id, 'x, Id('x),
          With('id, Num(2), App(Fun('id), Num(1))))

val exp5 : Exp =
  With('y, Num(1),
       WithFun('f, 'x, Add(Call('double, Id('x)), Id('y)),
               With('g, Call('twice, Fun('f)), App(Id('g), Num(1)))))

val emptyEnv : Env = Map()
val emptyFEnv : FEnv = Map()
val testFEnv : FEnv =
  Map('double -> Closure('x, Add(Id('x), Id('x)), emptyFEnv, emptyEnv),
      'twice -> Closure('f, WithFun('f2, 'x, App(Id('f), App(Id('f), Id('x))),
                                    Fun('f2)), emptyFEnv, emptyEnv))

def testEval1(exp : Exp) : Value = eval(exp, emptyFEnv, emptyEnv)
def testEval2(exp : Exp) : Value = eval(exp, testFEnv, emptyEnv)

assert(testEval1(exp1) == NumV(2))
assert(testEval1(exp2) == NumV(1))
assert(testEval1(exp3) == NumV(2))
assert(testEval1(exp4) == NumV(1))
assert(testEval2(exp5) == NumV(7))
```

What can you conclude from this exercise?
